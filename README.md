# hackathon-task-03

This is a React based Webapp and was written in Typescript. The main feature is to initialize and interact with a CCD smart contract 
"MyStorage" which was generated from my last hackathon task repo "hackathon-task-02". The contract ensures users to store an integer
number on the chain and view the current stored number at any time. Every one can store the number after 0.1 CCD paid to the contract 
owner and view the storage is free.
